<h1> Fast Fashion: What it is, it's impact and more.</h1>
<p>You may be wondering-- what even is Fast Fashion. Here's some of my current notes of Fast Fashion, written below.
 </p>   
 <h2>Impact on environment:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 
Just a single t-shirt takes up roughly 2700 litres of water. Manufacturing a simple cotton t-shirt uses harmful pesticides which hurts animals living around them, farmers because they breath in these gases and pollutes the air even further.
        </li>
        <li>
            Approximately 92 million tonnes of textile waste is produced anually throughout the world. The fashion industry is repsonsible for roughly 35% of the world ocean microplastic pollution.
        </li>




</ul>
<h2>Plan of action: Rough details</h2>
<ul>
<li> Convince classmates why Fast fashion is bad, explain the reasoning behind it and explain problems of fast fashion.</li>
<li> Add how this impacts them and go over impacts briefly</li>
<li>How can they use their rights and responsibilities we talked about in the classroom during social studies to make a difference in fast fashion?</li>



</ul>
