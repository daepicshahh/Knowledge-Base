    <h1>🧠 My Knowledge Base and Archive</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my abode of knowledge. This repository serves as my living reference guide and will be updated for as long as possible. If you have any concerns, questions, or comments about my website, they can be directed to shxhwxiz@gmail.com or my school email. 
        I was inspired to make this from my friend Vivan. Hosted on Github Pages! </p>
