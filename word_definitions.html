    <h1> Word definitions: Hard words</h1>
<p>Hello! It is Shah again. This page is just for word definitions that some people may not know and have been referenced or talked about in class. Will also include some brainrot/slang definitions. Always a WIP! </p>
<ul>
<li>Stakeholder: Someone who is impacted by the problem you're talking about.</li>
<li>Rez: Slang for First Nations Reserve. Was mentioned in The Case Of The Missing Auntie.</li>
<li>Johnny Whoop: An internet trend that has been repopularized, especially in my school. It's supposed to trick people, as people think they are doing it wrong. Instead, you have to cross your arms once you're done.</li>
<li>HTML: A coding language and what this website is made out of! Full name is Hyper-Text Markup Language, used to build websites.</li>
<li>Tbh: To be honest: Pretty much means, to be fair.</li>
<li>Characteristics: Something that describes a person. Can be physical like athletic, flexible or can be mental/based on someone's actions</li>














</ul>
